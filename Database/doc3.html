        <p>Understanding basic car repairs can save you money and help you maintain your vehicle properly. While major repairs should be left to professionals, knowing what's happening under the hood empowers you to make informed decisions about your car's maintenance and recognize when something needs immediate attention.</p>

        <h2>Brake Pad Replacement</h2>
        
        <p>Brake pads wear down over time through friction, and replacing them is one of the most common car repairs. Signs that your brake pads need replacement include squealing or grinding noises when braking, longer stopping distances, or a vibrating brake pedal. Most brake pads should be replaced every 30,000 to 70,000 miles, depending on driving habits and conditions.</p>

        <p>The repair process involves removing the wheels, compressing the brake caliper pistons, and installing new pads. While many car owners can handle this repair themselves, it's crucial to ensure proper installation since brakes are critical to safety. Professional mechanics typically charge between 150 and 300 dollars per axle for this service.</p>

        <h2>Battery Replacement</h2>
        
        <p>Car batteries typically last three to five years before needing replacement. A failing battery shows warning signs like slow engine cranking, dimming headlights, or the battery warning light on your dashboard. Extreme temperatures accelerate battery degradation, so those in very hot or cold climates may need more frequent replacements.</p>

        <p>Replacing a battery is straightforward: disconnect the negative terminal first, then the positive, remove the old battery, install the new one, and reconnect the terminals in reverse order. Most auto parts stores will test your battery for free and can install a replacement on the spot. Battery prices range from 50 to 200 dollars depending on the type and quality.</p>

        <h2>Oil Changes</h2>
        
        <p>Regular oil changes are essential for engine longevity. Engine oil lubricates moving parts, reduces friction, and helps dissipate heat. Over time, oil breaks down and accumulates contaminants that reduce its effectiveness. Most vehicles need oil changes every 5,000 to 7,500 miles for conventional oil, or up to 10,000 miles for synthetic oil.</p>

        <p>The process involves draining old oil from the oil pan, replacing the oil filter, and adding fresh oil to the proper level. While this is a simple repair that many people do themselves, it requires proper disposal of used oil and the right tools. Quick-lube shops typically charge 30 to 75 dollars for this service, making it one of the most affordable regular maintenance tasks.</p>

        <h2>Tire Rotation and Replacement</h2>
        
        <p>Tires should be rotated every 5,000 to 7,500 miles to ensure even wear across all four tires. Uneven tire wear can affect handling, fuel efficiency, and safety. Different vehicles have different rotation patterns depending on whether they're front-wheel, rear-wheel, or all-wheel drive.</p>

        <p>When tires reach the end of their life, typically after 25,000 to 50,000 miles, they need complete replacement. Signs include tread depth below 2/32 of an inch, visible cords or belts, sidewall damage, or frequent air pressure loss. Tire replacement costs vary widely based on tire size and quality, ranging from 400 to 1,000 dollars or more for a complete set.</p>

        <h2>Air Filter Replacement</h2>
        
        <p>The engine air filter prevents dirt and debris from entering the engine, protecting internal components from damage. A clogged air filter reduces engine performance, decreases fuel efficiency, and can cause rough idling. Most air filters should be replaced every 15,000 to 30,000 miles, though this varies based on driving conditions.</p>

        <p>Replacing an air filter is one of the easiest car repairs. It typically involves opening a plastic housing, removing the old filter, and inserting a new one. The entire process takes less than ten minutes and requires no tools for many vehicles. Air filters cost between 15 and 50 dollars, making this an inexpensive maintenance task that significantly impacts engine performance.</p>

        <h2>Spark Plug Replacement</h2>
        
        <p>Spark plugs ignite the air-fuel mixture in the engine's cylinders, and worn spark plugs can cause misfires, poor fuel economy, and difficulty starting. Most spark plugs last between 30,000 and 100,000 miles depending on the type. Copper plugs need more frequent replacement, while platinum and iridium plugs last longer.</p>

        <p>Replacing spark plugs requires removing the plug wires or ignition coils, using a spark plug socket to remove old plugs, and installing new ones to the proper torque specification. The number of spark plugs varies by engine—four-cylinder engines have four, while V8 engines have eight. Professional replacement typically costs between 100 and 300 dollars including parts and labor.</p>

        <h2>Alternator Replacement</h2>
        
        <p>The alternator charges the battery and powers electrical systems while the engine runs. A failing alternator causes warning lights on the dashboard, dimming lights, strange noises, or electrical issues. Without a functioning alternator, the car will run only until the battery drains completely.</p>

        <p>Alternator replacement involves disconnecting the battery, removing the serpentine belt, disconnecting electrical connections, and installing the new alternator. This repair is more complex than basic maintenance and typically requires professional service. Alternators cost between 300 and 700 dollars installed, depending on the vehicle make and model.</p>

        <h2>Understanding When to DIY vs. Professional Service</h2>
        
        <p>While some repairs are suitable for home mechanics with basic tools and knowledge, others require specialized equipment and expertise. Simple maintenance like air filters, batteries, and wiper blades can often be handled at home. However, brake work, suspension repairs, and anything involving the engine's internal components should be left to certified mechanics who have proper training and tools.</p>

        <p>Attempting complex repairs without proper knowledge can lead to safety issues or more expensive problems down the road. When in doubt, consulting with a trusted mechanic is the safest approach. Regular maintenance and addressing small issues promptly prevent larger, more expensive repairs later, keeping your vehicle running safely and reliably for years to come.</p>
