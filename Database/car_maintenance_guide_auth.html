            <h2>The Importance of Car Maintenance</h2>
            <p>
                When you perform car maintenance at regular intervals, it keeps your ride in proper working order and helps prevent expensive mechanical repairs down the road. Keeping or having detailed service records can help boost the vehicle’s value when it’s time to sell or trade in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vehicle maintenance requires some investment of time and money, but taking care of your car can help you avoid major repair costs following a roadside breakdown. We make getting maintenance pricing for your vehicle easy, so you’ll know how much you can expect to pay in your area.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, know that failing to follow preventative auto maintenance guidelines could void the vehicle’s warranty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scheduled maintenance checkups address a vehicle’s fluid levels for brake and power steering systems, radiator coolant, and engine oil. Other items with significant safety purposes, such as brake pads and windshield wipers, should be checked routinely and replaced when necessary to keep them operating effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                Automobile engines are complex machines containing many interconnected parts. Proper mechanical maintenance, including replacing spark plugs, drive belts, timing belts or chains, and air and fluid filters, is needed to identify problems and keep the engine running as it should.

            <h2>How Often Should You Take Your Car in for an Inspection?</h2>
            <p>
                Always follow the manufacturer’s maintenance recommendations in your vehicle’s owner’s manual. At the least, you should have your car inspected by a qualified mechanic every 12 months to look for problems. Please note that many vehicle manufacturers have replaced the familiar printed owner’s manual with an online version available through the manufacturer’s website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some states require inspections for all cars or smog checks for registration renewal, depending on the county you live in and the age of your vehicle. These emissions and safety inspections evaluate only vehicle exhaust or essential safety criteria rather than a full mechanical inspection of the car’s health.
            </p>
            <p>
                Changing your car’s oil at a repair shop or dealership usually includes a multipoint inspection to check fluid levels, filters, and other components. In previous decades, a rule of thumb was to change a car’s oil every 3,000 miles. Since 2010, many vehicles have used synthetic oil that can go up to 10,000 miles between changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Manufacturers outline auto maintenance requirements such as oil changes and tire rotation. They also recommend inspection schedules or parts replacement when the odometer reaches 30,000 miles, 60,000 miles, and 90,000 miles, for example. Again, refer to the owner’s manual for your vehicle’s maintenance schedule.

            <h2>Signs My Car Needs Maintenance Done</h2>
            <p>
                Even the most well-maintained car will encounter problems that require unexpected service. Often, the vehicle will let you know before it stops operating that there’s an issue needing attention.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Braking: Any problem with your brakes is a critical safety issue. Immediately address a “soft” brake pedal or any squeaking or scraping sounds.</li>
                <li>Lacking acceleration: A change in vehicle performance may mean it’s time for new spark plugs or a complete engine tuneup.</li>
                <li>Vibration: If you feel the car shaking when starting, turning, or stopping, have a mechanic diagnose the cause.</li>
                <li>Stalling or difficulty starting: When your vehicle stalls or won’t start, it’s time to check with a mechanic for a solution to the problem.</li>
                <li>Fuel efficiency: Bad sensors or leaky fuel injectors might be the reason for changes in your gas mileage.</li>
                <li>Shifting: Automatic transmissions are designed to shift gears smoothly. Hard shifts and lurching might indicate a transmission problem.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There are less obvious clues that something might be wrong with the car, and these signs can be intermittent or vague. Remember that you know how your car drives better than anyone does. If something seems different, it might be the start of a more significant problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Contact a trusted mechanic at your local dealership or car repair shop when your vehicle isn’t performing well. Tell them what you feel and hear when the car begins acting up.

            <h2>Car Maintenance Checklist</h2>

            <h3>Service Immediately</h3>
            <p>
                Check engine light: This warning appears when the car’s control system discovers a problem. There is no reason to panic when you see this yellow warning light, but don’t delay a visit to the repair shop. Don’t reset a check engine light on your own without knowing why it came on in the first place. A mechanic can run diagnostic tests to determine the cause.
            </p>
            <p>
                Headlights/taillights: If a light goes out, check for blown fuses. Replace the light if that isn’t the problem. Driving with burned-out lights is unsafe and can result in a traffic ticket.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tire pressure light: A car’s tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) will alert you when the air pressure in a tire drops below a certain amount. Low air pressure can bring unsafe driving conditions, so inflate your tires to proper levels as soon as possible.
            </p>

            <h3>Monthly Checkup</h3>
            <p>
                Fog lights, turn signals, brake, and parking lights: It’s relatively easy to notice a headlight that isn’t working. Others aren’t as obvious, so walk around the car monthly to visually inspect the lights.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oil and coolant levels: Check the levels when the engine is cool at least once a month, and always top them off before making a long trip.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tire pressure and tread depth: Tires are essential to safe driving. Regularly inspect your tires and the spare for uneven wear, proper air pressure, and adequate tread depth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Windshield wiper fluid: Be sure the reservoir has an adequate supply of wiper fluid. A dirty windshield obstructs your view of the road, making it impossible to drive safely.
            </p>

            <h3>Annual Checkup</h3>
            <p>
                Air filters: Cabin air filters help clean the air inside the car and require annual replacement. However, engine air filters keep debris out of your engine and should be inspected during oil changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Brakes: Inspect the brake system, including the brake fluid, brake linings, rotors, and brake pads, to help ensure the proper operation of these critical components. Brake fluid typically needs replacing at 30,000-mile intervals. The lifespan of brake pads largely depends on the operator’s driving style.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inspect shocks and struts: If you notice a decrease in smoothness when driving, take your car to the shop. Shocks and struts are an essential part of the car’s steering system and should be inspected by a professional.
            </p>

            <h2>Electric Car Maintenance</h2>
            <p>
                Electric vehicles (EVs) have fewer moving parts than gas-powered cars, resulting in less frequent maintenance and less time in the shop. EVs do not require oil changes, engine air filters, or fuel filters, but do need regular checks of suspension, steering, and other chassis components. Still, regular maintenance remains essential for safe operation and preventing expensive issues.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rotate tires regularly (about every 7,500 miles) to prevent uneven wear, as EVs are heavier and can wear tires faster.</li>
                <li>Monitor tire tread and maintain proper inflation for safety and efficiency.</li>
                <li>Replace windshield wiper blades and refill washer fluid as needed for clear visibility.</li>
                <li>Replace the cabin air filter annually or as recommended to keep the interior air fresh.</li>
                <li>Inspect and maintain the battery thermal management system; check coolant levels and hoses, and follow the manufacturer’s schedule for coolant replacement.</li>
                <li>For good battery health, use shorter, more frequent charging cycles and try to keep it charged between 30% and 80%.</li>
                <li>Take advantage of regenerative braking, but remember to lubricate brake calipers and check brake fluid regularly, as mechanical brakes are used less often.</li>
                <li>Install software updates for vehicle systems.</li>
            </ul>
