        <p>We've all been there before. You experience some difficulty with your car, and suddenly, your daily activities are hindered at best. At worst, you'll be without transportation for a few days. Most likely, two thoughts begin racing through your mind: &#8220;How did this happen?&#8221; and "Is there a mechanic near me?" Today, we&#8217;re going to answer both of those questions to the best of our ability.</p>
<p>These are the common situations that many drivers find themselves in and some of the factors that cause them. Here at Loganville Ford, our parts and service department is always ready to assist customers in need and diagnose the root cause of what brought you to us in the first place. A better understanding of what might cause a potential issue can help you prevent one from happening.</p>


        <section class="section">
            <h2>The Car Won't Start</h2>
           <p>Believe it or not, this is one of the most common problems and has multiple causes. If you turn the key in your ignition and the engine doesn't power on or "turn over," a few root causes may be at fault. A dead battery is the most common cause of an engine not turning over. Car batteries aren't like the ones you have in your drawer at home and are designed to last for a long time. If the battery still has juice, there could be a faulty connection. Check the connectors of your battery; rust and corrosion can inhibit it from working properly.</p>
<p>Your battery might be dead due to a faulty alternator. This alternator keeps your battery charged when it's not in use. Sometimes, the culprit can be a broken belt that prevents your alternator from functioning properly. Another possible culprit is your spark plugs, which are imperative to your engine turning over during ignition.</p>

            <h2><span class="cms-font-inner-span" data-font-value="Medium" data-font-label="Medium">Engine Overheating</span></h2>
            <p>Similar to your engine not turning over and starting properly, an overheated engine can be caused by multiple things. We consulted our experts, and these are some of the most common.</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Lack of Engine Oil:</strong> Getting your oil changed regularly is of the utmost importance. The oil keeps the moving parts of your engine properly lubricated and running smoothly. Not having oil or having dirty oil in your engine can lead to excessive overheating. This will cause the oil to burn, leading to an unpleasant odor.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Coolant:</strong> Coolant, sometimes called antifreeze, keeps your engine from overheating in the summer and freezing in the winter. Sometimes, an overheating engine is caused by low coolant levels. Sometimes, this is simply a matter of refilling the coolant in your engine. However, sometimes, there might be a leak or a faulty connection, which must be handled.</li>
                <li><strong>Broken Radiator:</strong> The radiator in your car plays a major role in preventing your engine from overheating. When used, the radiator absorbs heat generated by the engine and keeps the compartment cool. A broken radiator will cause your engine to overheat.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Whatever the cause, an overheating engine should be attended to as soon as possible. Prolonged use can lead to expensive damages, such as a complete breakdown or cylinder malfunction.</p>

            <h2>My Transmission is Slipping</h2>
                <p>The transmission in your car is a vital part of its daily use and performance. Depending on whether you have an automatic or a manual transmission, you might notice slippage and issues when shifting gears. There are a number of symptoms to be mindful of.</p>
                <p><strong>Burnt Smell:</strong> Like your engine, dirty transmission fluid can cause a faulty or slipping transmission. Believe it or not, adding or changing transmission fluid is a much more complex process than changing your engine oil, particularly if you have an automatic transmission. The fluid must be measured while on level ground to determine whether it needs replacing.</p>
                <p><strong>Grinding Noises and Diminished Acceleration:</strong> A transmission in a disrepair state will limit your ability to accelerate. This can be due to either age or a lack of fluid. Transmissions can be very costly to repair, as many require rebuilding or complete replacement. The problems we listed here usually pertain to an automatic transmission. However, if you drive a car with a manual transmission and find that these problems occur, it usually results from a faulty clutch. Either way, you must bring your vehicle right away for servicing.</p>
                <h2>The Check Engine Light is On</h2>
                <p>The "check engine" light can indicate any number of potential issues with your car because the check engine light doesn't pinpoint an exact problem. To give you an idea of what might be the reason for it turning on and off, here are some of the most common causes.</p>
                <p><strong>Faulty Sensor:</strong> Modern vehicles are more advanced than ever. A host of onboard computers and sensors monitor almost everything, from low tire pressure to oxygen and emissions. If one of these sensors stops working properly, the check engine light might come on. Luckily, a skilled technician can perform a diagnostic test to ensure all sensors are working properly and determine if one is malfunctioning.</p>
                <p><strong>Loose Fuel Cap:</strong> This is a fairly common occurrence and easily solved. If you've just gone for a fill-up and the fuel cap hasn't been secured properly, the check engine light might come on.</p>
                <p><strong>Emissions Issue:</strong> Most states require yearly emissions tests to ensure that your car's exhaust system is functioning properly. In between these tests, there's a possibility that a leak has occurred or the catalytic converter isn't functioning properly. This can also trigger the check engine light to come on.</p>
                <p><strong>Faulty Wiring or Connections:</strong> Your engine is a collection of moving parts that work in unison. These moving parts are interconnected with a series of belts, wires, hoses, and other connections. A leak, misplaced connection, or faulty wiring can all cause the check engine light to turn on.</p>

            <h2>Braking Issues</h2>
            <p>Your car&#8217;s braking system is just as, if not more, essential for maintaining safety than your seat belts and airbags. A faulty braking system can lead to costly repairs and present a safety hazard to you, your passengers, and the other vehicles and pedestrians you share the road with. These are some of the symptoms and warning signs that you need to have your brakes serviced.</p>
            <p><strong>Grinding:</strong> Grinding brakes usually means that your pads have worn down and the caliper and rotors are grinding together. If you notice screeching even when no pressure is being applied to the brakes, this can indicate dust or debris in your braking system. Either way, you must have them looked at immediately.</p>
            <p><strong>Brakes Not Engaging or a Faulty Brake Pedal:</strong> Fluid is a key component of your car&#8217;s braking system. It allows your brakes to engage and operate properly. If it takes a lot of pressure on the pedal to make your brakes engage, there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;re low on fluid, or a faulty connection prevents the brake fluid from being released. Bringing your vehicle for an inspection right away can prevent this from becoming a potential safety issue.</p>
