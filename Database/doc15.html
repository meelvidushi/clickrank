        <p>New England offers some of the most diverse and scenic hiking opportunities on the East Coast. From the rocky peaks of New Hampshire's White Mountains to the coastal paths of Maine's Acadia National Park, the region provides trails for every skill level and interest. Understanding what each area offers helps hikers plan adventures that match their abilities and goals, whether seeking challenging summit climbs or peaceful woodland walks.</p>

        <h2>Mount Washington: Tuckerman Ravine Trail</h2>
        
        <p>Mount Washington stands as the Northeast's highest peak at 6,288 feet, and the Tuckerman Ravine Trail offers the most popular route to the summit. This eight-mile round trip climb gains over 4,000 feet in elevation, making it a serious undertaking that requires proper preparation. The trail passes through Tuckerman Ravine, a glacial cirque famous for late-season skiing and dramatic scenery.</p>

        <p>Weather on Mount Washington changes rapidly and can turn dangerous without warning. The summit holds the record for the highest wind speed ever recorded on Earth at 231 miles per hour. Even in summer, temperatures at the top can be 30 degrees colder than at the base, and afternoon thunderstorms develop frequently. Successful hikers start early, carry extra layers, and turn back if conditions deteriorate. Despite the challenges, reaching the summit rewards hikers with panoramic views across three states on clear days.</p>

        <h2>Franconia Ridge Loop</h2>
        
        <p>The Franconia Ridge Loop in New Hampshire's White Mountains ranks among the most spectacular day hikes in the Northeast. This 8.9-mile loop traverses three peaks above treeline: Little Haystack, Mount Lincoln, and Mount Lafayette. The exposed ridge walk offers continuous views of surrounding mountains and valleys, creating an alpine experience rare in the eastern United States.</p>

        <p>The loop's popularity means crowded trails, especially on summer weekends. Hikers should arrive at the trailhead early to secure parking and avoid afternoon storms that threaten the exposed ridge. The trail's difficulty lies not just in its 3,800-foot elevation gain but in the rocky, uneven terrain that demands careful foot placement. Many hikers consider this trail the finest in the White Mountains, and the dramatic scenery justifies its reputation despite the physical demands.</p>

        <h2>Acadia National Park: Precipice Trail</h2>
        
        <p>Acadia National Park on Maine's Mount Desert Island features unique hiking combining mountain views with coastal scenery. The Precipice Trail exemplifies Acadia's distinctive character with its iron rungs, ladders, and exposed ledges ascending sheer cliff faces. This 2.2-mile round trip gains 1,000 feet, but the vertical nature of the climb makes it feel much longer and more intense.</p>

        <p>The trail closes annually from spring through mid-summer to protect nesting peregrine falcons, and park officials enforce this closure strictly. When open, the Precipice requires both physical fitness and comfort with heights and exposure. Hikers must use installed iron rungs and ladders to navigate vertical sections where a slip could prove fatal. Despite the intensity, the summit of Champlain Mountain provides stunning views of Frenchman Bay and the surrounding islands, making the challenging ascent worthwhile for those comfortable with the exposure.</p>

        <h2>Vermont's Long Trail: Camel's Hump</h2>
        
        <p>Vermont's Long Trail, the nation's oldest long-distance hiking trail, stretches 273 miles along the state's spine. Camel's Hump stands as one of the trail's highlights, offering a 4,083-foot summit with panoramic views. The most popular route, the Burrows Trail, covers 5.2 miles round trip with 2,450 feet of elevation gain, providing a challenging but achievable day hike.</p>

        <p>Camel's Hump's distinctive profile makes it recognizable across Vermont, and its alpine zone above treeline supports rare arctic-alpine plants. Hikers must stay on marked trails in these fragile areas to prevent vegetation damage. The summit's 360-degree views encompass Lake Champlain, the Adirondacks, the Green Mountains, and even Mount Washington on clear days. Fall foliage season transforms the lower slopes into a spectacular display of color, though crowds increase significantly during peak foliage weeks.</p>

        <h2>Massachusetts: Mount Greylock</h2>
        
        <p>Mount Greylock, Massachusetts' highest peak at 3,491 feet, offers multiple trail options through diverse terrain. The Appalachian Trail crosses the summit, and day hikers can access the peak via several routes of varying difficulty. The Thunderbolt Trail, once a famous ski run, provides the most challenging ascent with steep grades and loose rocks. More moderate options like the Hopper Trail offer gentler grades through beautiful forests.</p>

        <p>The summit features the Veterans War Memorial Tower, a distinctive landmark visible for miles. On clear days, views extend to five states and as far as the Catskills and Green Mountains. The mountain's size creates its own weather patterns, often shrouding the summit in clouds while surrounding valleys remain clear. The extensive trail network allows for loop hikes of various lengths, making Greylock accessible to hikers of different abilities.</p>

        <h2>Connecticut: Bear Mountain</h2>
        
        <p>Bear Mountain in Connecticut's northwest corner rises to 2,323 feet, making it the state's highest peak. The 5.5-mile loop via the Undermountain and Paradise Lane trails provides a satisfying day hike with about 1,800 feet of elevation gain. The summit offers views of the Taconic Range and Housatonic Valley, particularly beautiful during fall foliage season.</p>

        <p>Connecticut's relatively modest mountains make them ideal for beginning hikers or those seeking less demanding terrain. Bear Mountain's well-maintained trails and moderate grades allow families and casual hikers to experience summit views without the intense effort required by higher peaks. The Appalachian Trail crosses the summit, connecting to longer hiking opportunities for those interested in multi-day adventures.</p>

        <h2>Maine's 100-Mile Wilderness</h2>
        
        <p>For experienced backpackers, Maine's 100-Mile Wilderness section of the Appalachian Trail represents one of the East Coast's premier wilderness experiences. This remote stretch between Monson and Baxter State Park contains no paved roads or services, requiring hikers to carry all supplies for the journey. The trail traverses rugged terrain with significant elevation changes, multiple river crossings, and weather that can turn harsh without warning.</p>

        <p>Most hikers take seven to ten days to complete the section, though elite backpackers occasionally finish faster. The wilderness designation means minimal trail maintenance and a true backcountry experience. Wildlife encounters are common, including moose, black bears, and various birds. Successful completion requires careful planning, proper equipment, and solid backcountry skills. The 100-Mile Wilderness concludes at Mount Katahdin, the Appalachian Trail's northern terminus and a fitting end to this challenging section.</p>

        <h2>White Mountain Hut System</h2>
        
        <p>The Appalachian Mountain Club operates eight mountain huts across New Hampshire's White Mountains, creating unique hiking opportunities. These backcountry lodges provide meals and bunk space, allowing hikers to travel light without tents or cooking gear. Hut-to-hut hiking lets people explore remote areas while enjoying the comfort of prepared meals and dry sleeping quarters.</p>

        <p>Reservations for summer weekends fill up months in advance, but weekday availability and shoulder season options often exist. The system makes multi-day hiking accessible to those who might find traditional backpacking too demanding. However, hut fees run higher than camping costs, and the social atmosphere doesn't appeal to everyone. For many, the huts provide an ideal introduction to overnight hiking, building confidence for future backpacking adventures.</p>

        <h2>Seasonal Considerations and Safety</h2>
        
        <p>New England's hiking season varies by elevation and location. Lower elevation trails become accessible in April, while higher peaks may retain snow into June. Fall offers spectacular foliage and comfortable temperatures but draws large crowds during peak color weeks. Winter hiking requires specialized equipment and knowledge, as even moderate trails become serious undertakings under snow and ice.</p>

        <p>Preparation makes the difference between enjoyable hikes and dangerous situations. Hikers should carry the ten essentials: navigation tools, sun protection, insulation, illumination, first aid supplies, fire starter, repair tools, nutrition, hydration, and emergency shelter. Weather forecasts matter, especially for above-treeline hiking where conditions change rapidly. Telling someone your plans and expected return time provides a safety net if problems arise. New England's mountains may not match western peaks in height, but they demand respect and proper preparation from everyone who ventures onto the trails.</p>
