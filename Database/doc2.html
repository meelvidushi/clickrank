            <h2>Replace Windshield Wiper Blades</h2>
            <p>It's easy to tell when your blades need replacing. Simply press the washer button and see if your blades wipe clean. If they streak, they're toast. The auto parts store will have lots of economy blades, but go with a name brand instead (ANCO, Trico or Bosch). They cost more than economy blades, but their higher-quality rubber wipes better, has better UV protection and lasts longer.</p>
            <p>Follow the installation instructions on the package. Be sure you have a firm grip on the wiper arm once you remove the old blade. If it gets away from you, it can hit the windshield with enough force to crack it.</p>

<h2>Replace Headlights</h2>
<p>The hardest part of the job is choosing a new bulb. You can spend more time shopping for the bulbs than it takes to install them. The choices are mind-boggling. Every bulb manufacturer has its own confusing names for each style, making comparisons difficult. But it boils down to four upgrade categories—brightness level, life span, light color and energy consumption. See which bulb to pick and how to install a new headlight.</p>

</div>


<h2>Refinish Wheels and Wheel Covers</h2>
<p>Sometimes a middle-aged car can still look fine except for wear and tear on the wheels and wheel covers. Fortunately, you can fix this yourself for little cash. Removing the rust and painting your wheels take a full day. (Don’t panic—mostly you’re waiting for paint to dry.) Then the wheels must dry for 24 more hours after painting before you remount them. So make other arrangements for transportation for a day. The supplies cost about $50 from any auto parts store. See <a href="https://www.familyhandyman.com/project/how-to-refinish-wheels/" tabindex="0" aria-label="how to refinish wheels at home." data-name="Shop Now" data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">how to refinish wheels at home.</a></p>
</div>

	
<h2>Replace Struts Yourself</h2>
<p>If you’ve put 80,000 or more miles on your struts, they’re worn out and must be replaced. We know they’re expensive (about $700 for front <a href="https://www.familyhandyman.com/project/how-to-replace-your-own-struts/" tabindex="0" aria-label="struts replaced" data-name="Shop Now" data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">struts replaced</a> at a shop). But in the long run, driving on worn struts actually costs you more. You could save $300 doing struts yourself.</p>
	
<h2>Free Up a Sticking Hood Latch</h2>
<p>If your hood doesn’t latch and unlatch easily, chances are it’s just rusty and dry. You can fix the problem in about 10 minutes with spray rust penetrant and spray lithium grease. Pop the hood and saturate the entire latch mechanism with rust penetrant. Latch and unlatch the hood several times until the mechanism works smoothly. The rust penetrant won’t last long, so you’ll have to apply a better lube. Open the hood and spray all the moving parts with white lithium grease. Latch and unlatch the hood several more times and you’re good to go. There is a difference between rust penetrant and <a href="https://www.familyhandyman.com/list/brilliant-ways-to-use-wd-40/" tabindex="0" aria-label="WD-40, which is still great at scaring away spiders, believe it or not" data-name="Shop Now" data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">WD-40, which is still great at scaring away spiders, believe it or not</a>.</p>

Spray the opening to the hitch receiver. This newest style of penetrating fluid chills the metal, causing it to contract to help break the rust seal. Then use an air chisel fitted with a hammer bit to knock everything loose. The air hammer will break up the rust, spread the penetrant and free up the ball mount. Once it's free, just tap out the rusted ball mount with a regular hammer. If you plan to reuse the rusty mount, coat it with a rust converter or waterproof marine grease. <a href="https://www.familyhandyman.com/list/upgrade-your-utility-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" tabindex="0" aria-label="Check out these great trailer upgrades" data-name="Shop Now" data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">Check out these great trailer upgrades</a>!</div></div>

<h2>Change Your Engine Coolant</h2>
<p>You can change your coolant yourself in about an hour. You’ll need to invest in an air-powered refilling tool to remove air pockets from the cooling system as you fill. You’ll save about $50 on your first coolant change and about $100 on each one after that. Check out <a href="https://www.familyhandyman.com/project/how-to-change-your-engine-coolant/" tabindex="0" aria-label="how to change your engine coolant here" data-name="Shop Now" data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">how to change your engine coolant here</a>.</p>

<h2>Remove a Stubborn Oil Filter</h2>
<p>We’ve all done it—overtightened an oil filter so much that it’s a bear to remove. If you think you can remove it by jamming a long screwdriver through the can and twisting, think again. The screwdriver will just rip the can open and you’ll be drenched in oil. When you’re done dealing with that mess, the filter will still be stuck and you’ll be even more frustrated. To remove a stuck filter, use a band-type wrench that you’ve lined with coarse-grit adhesive-backed sandpaper. Learn what you need to know about <a href="https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/changing-car-oil-filter/" tabindex="0" aria-label="changing your oil filter" data-name="Shop Now" data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">changing your oil filter</a> and why your <a href="https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/why-is-my-oil-filter-leaking/" tabindex="0" aria-label="oil filter is leaking" data-name="Shop Now" data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">oil filter is leaking</a>.</p>
<h2>Swap Out Brake Fluid</h2>
<p>Some carmakers recommend replacing brake fluid every two years or 24,000 miles. Others don’t mention it at all. <a href="https://www.familyhandyman.com/project/how-to-check-brake-fluid/" tabindex="0" aria-label="But it’s easy to test your brake fluid" data-name="Shop Now" data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">But it’s easy to test your brake fluid</a>. Just dip a test strip into the fluid and compare the color to the chart on the packaging.</p>
<p>You can’t do a complete brake fluid flush yourself, but you can do the next best thing—a fluid swap. This procedure won’t replace all the old fluid with fresh, but you’ll introduce enough new fluid to make a difference.</p>
<p>Use a baster to suck out the dark brown brake fluid (brake and power steering fluids are incompatible, so use a different baster for each). Squirt it into a recycling bottle. Refill the reservoir with fresh brake fluid as shown. Then drive the vehicle for a week to mix the new fluid with the old. Repeat the procedure several times over the next few weeks until the fluid in the reservoir retains its light honey color.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The brake fluid may damage the baster’s rubber bulb, so don’t suck the fluid all the way into the bulb.</p>

	
<h2>Change Power Steering Fluid</h2>
<p>There aren’t any test strips for power steering fluid, so you’ll have to rely on the manufacturer’s service recommendations or general rule-of-thumb (two years or 24,000 miles). Use the turkey baster method to remove the old power steering fluid. Suck out all the fluid (engine off) as shown. Then refill the reservoir with fresh fluid. Start the engine and let it run for about 15 seconds. Repeat the fluid swap procedure until you’ve used up the full quart.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Never substitute a “universal” power steering fluid for the recommended type, and never add “miracle” additives or stop-leak products. They can clog the fine mesh filter screens in your steering system and cause expensive failures.</p>

<h2>Repack Trailer Wheel Bearings</h2>
<p>Repack trailer wheel bearings to prevent the most common breakdown. It’s an easy and cheap <a href="https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/best-maintenance-apps-for-your-car/" tabindex="0" aria-label="maintenance chore" data-name="Shop Now" data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">maintenance chore</a>.

<h2>Battery Terminals</h2>

<h2>Check the Level of the Electrolyte</h2>
<p>Gently pry off the covers of the battery cells. The water and acid mixture in the battery (electrolyte) should be about 1/2 in. deep or to the bottom of the fill hole. If it needs water, use clean distilled water, being careful not to overfill the cells, and then inspect the battery case for cracks. If you find a crack, replace the battery. If you added water, let the water mix with the electrolyte for a few hours before the next step. (You may need to reconnect the battery to maintain your memory functions.) <a href="https://www.familyhandyman.com/list/tips-to-make-your-car-battery-last-longer/" tabindex="0" aria-label="Check out more battery care tips here." data-name="Shop Now" data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">Check out more battery care tips here.</a></p>

<h2>Repair Rust on a Car</h2>
<p>Sure, you can lower your risk of rust by applying paint protection film to chip-prone areas like the front edge of the hood, and by frequently washing off road salt and waxing your vehicle regularly. But even then, you’re still going to get rust spots. If you ignore them, they’ll spread and turn your sheet metal into Swiss cheese in no time. <a href="https://www.familyhandyman.com/project/how-to-repair-rust-on-a-car/" tabindex="0" aria-label="However, if you deal with rust early, you can stop it from spreading and squeeze a few extra years out of your vehicle." data-name="Shop Now" data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">However, if you deal with rust early, you can stop it from spreading and squeeze a few extra years out of your vehicle.</a></p>

<h2>Fix a Bad Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor</h2>
<p>See the crack? This sensor didn’t set off a trouble code or “check engine” light. But the owner had to pump the pedal to keep the engine running.</p>
<p>The computer in every fuel-injected car must know two things before it can figure out the correct cold-start air/fuel mixture: the engine coolant temperature and the outside air temperature. Your symptoms are a dead ringer for a bad engine coolant temperature sensor (ECT). The computer is calculating an air/fuel mixture that is too lean. That’s why pumping the gas pedal keeps your engine running. You can have a bad sensor even without a “check engine” light or trouble code. They’re so cheap (about $15) and easy to replace, that it makes more sense to just replace it. Ask the auto parts store clerk to find the right sensor for you (you may have two—one for the computer and one for the temp gauge on your dash) and to show you where it installs on your engine. <a href="https://www.familyhandyman.com/project/trouble-starting-the-car-replace-the-coolant-temperature-sensor/" tabindex="0" aria-label="Check out how to replace the coolant temperature sensor here." data-name="Shop Now" data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">Check out how to replace the coolant temperature sensor here.</a></p>
