        The automotive repair industry is transforming rapidly with new tools,
        data systems, and diagnostic technologies. Today’s workshops look more
        like laboratories than old-fashioned garages — precision and data have
        replaced guesswork.

      <section class="section" id="diagnostics">
        <h2>Digital Diagnostics</h2>
        <p>
          Advanced OBD-II scanners and software now pinpoint faults within
          seconds. Mechanics use laptops and tablets to read error codes,
          monitor live data, and even reprogram engine control units (ECUs).

      <section class="section" id="automation">
        <h2>Automation and Robotics</h2>
        <p>
          Some high-end repair shops are introducing automated tire changers,
          robotic lifts, and AI-driven inspection systems. These innovations
          improve consistency, safety, and turnaround time.

      <section class="section" id="software">
        <h2>Shop Management Software</h2>
        <p>
          Modern software platforms help manage appointments, track repairs, and
          monitor parts inventory. Cloud-based systems allow shop owners to
          oversee operations from anywhere — improving efficiency and customer
          satisfaction.

      <section class="section" id="future">
        <h2>Preparing for the Future</h2>
        <p>
          Electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids bring new challenges. Shops now
          train technicians in high-voltage safety, battery diagnostics, and
          charging systems — skills essential for the next generation of
          automotive service.

        <h2>Innovation Drives Reliability</h2>
        <p>
          Technology doesn’t replace mechanics — it empowers them. The
          combination of skill and smart tools ensures that modern repair shops
          stay efficient, safe, and ready for the cars of tomorrow.
